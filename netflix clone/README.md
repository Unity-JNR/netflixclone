# VUE Netflix clone

## Description

The aim of this project is to use VUE to make a functional clone of Netflix

## Features

1. The ability to sign in and out
2. A banner that advertises new and upcoming films and series
3. A grid of films and series divided into different genres
4. The ability to add and remove items to a watch list
5. A page for viewing items in your watch list

## MVP

- Ensure that the landing page looks like the Netflix landing page
- Allow users to add and delete movies from the watchlist
- Have a max of 20 movies on the watchlist
- Watchlist movies remain in place even after page refresh
- Search a movie by name or actor's name
- There is no need to include a login page, but we won't stop you if you do
